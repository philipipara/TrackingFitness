# TrackingFitness
Record exercises and save them to various work outs, then see your your data as you progress in real time. 
This application solves the problem of working out and not tracking what you do in your workouts. Many people
will go to the gym and go through workouts without tracking their progress. Say one week you are lifting 40lb
dumbbells for arms then the next week want to increase weight and do not remember what you started with the
week prior, this will help track the progress. Furthermore, if a user did not finish a workout can come back
and complete it.
